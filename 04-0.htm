                  management is among the most critical activities that you must 
                  perform to maintain a stable Linux system. In simple 
                  situations, after a successful installation, you may never 
                  have a problem or need to manage filesystem specifics. 
                  However, understanding how to configure and maintain Linux 
                  filesystems is essential to safely manage your system and to 
                  pass Exam 101. This section contains these Objectives: </P>
                  <DL class=docList>
                    <DT><I><SPAN class=docPubcolor>Objective 1: Create 
                    Partitions and Filesystems</SPAN></I> 
                    <DD>
                    <P class=docList>Most Linux distributions will automate 
                    initial filesystem creation on your system for you. However, 
                    subsequent management of partitions, particularly on large 
                    systems and multiboot configurations, requires specific 
                    knowledge. This Objective involves the creation of disk 
                    partitions using <SPAN class=docEmphBold>fdisk,</SPAN><I> 
                    </I>and filesystem creation using <SPAN 
                    class=docEmphBold>mkfs</SPAN>. Weight: 3. </P>
                    <DT><I><SPAN class=docPubcolor>Objective 2: Maintain the 
                    Integrity of Filesystems</SPAN></I> 
                    <DD>
                    <P class=docList>At one time or another, you will probably 
                    find yourself stuck with an ailing filesystem. It could be a 
                    small problem resulting from a system crash, or it could be 
                    a total disk failure. Whatever the cause, you must be 
                    prepared to work with <SPAN class=docEmphBold>fsck</SPAN> to 
                    repair problems. This Objective also covers the handy <SPAN 
                    class=docEmphBold>du</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                    class=docEmphBold>df</SPAN> commands, which will help you 
                    with monitoring filesystem properties. Weight: 5. </P>
                    <DT><I><SPAN class=docPubcolor>Objective 3: Control 
                    Filesystem Mounting and Unmounting</SPAN></I> 
                    <DD>
                    <P class=docList>Under Linux, a filesystem is not available 
                    for use unless it is <SPAN class=docEmphasis>mounted</SPAN>. 
                    When the system boots, it mounts its filesystems according 
                    to instructions in the important <I>/etc/fstab</I> file. 
                    This Objective covers the management of this file, manual 
                    mounting of filesystems, and configuration of user-mountable 
                    removable filesystems. Weight: 3. </P>
                    <DT><I><SPAN class=docPubcolor>Objective 4: Set and View 
                    Disk Quotas</SPAN></I> 
                    <DD>
                    <P class=docList>When running a system with multiple users, 
                    you may find some of them competing for disk space. Managing 
                    that problem gets much easier when you enforce <SPAN 
                    class=docEmphasis>disk quotas</SPAN>, which allocate finite 
                    amounts of space to individual user accounts. Setup and 
                    management of quotas is covered by this Objective. Weight: 
                    1. </P>
                    <DT><I><SPAN class=docPubcolor>Objective 5: Use File 
                    Permissions to Control Access to Files</SPAN></I> 
                    <DD>
                    <P class=docList>Linux file permissions are a critical part 
                    of any system's security policy. This Objective covers 
                    permissions on files and directories, including special 
                    modes. Weight: 3. </P></DD></DL>

                    Ownership</SPAN></I> 
                    <DD>
                    <P class=docList>File ownership is a fundamental part of the 
                    access control described in Objective 5. This Objective 
                    covers the management of user and group ownership. Weight: 
                    2. </P>
                    <DT><I><SPAN class=docPubcolor>Objective 7: Create and 
                    Change Hard and Symbolic Links</SPAN></I> 
                    <DD>
                    <P class=docList>The Linux filesystem allows the creation of 
                    filesystem links. Links allow multiple filenames to point to 
                    the same file, a handy way of having the same file appear in 
                    more than one place or under different names. This Objective 
                    covers both hard and soft (symbolic) links. Weight: 2. </P>
                    <DT><I><SPAN class=docPubcolor>Objective 8: Find System 
                    Files and Place Files in the Correct Location</SPAN></I> 
                    <DD>
                    <P class=docList>Linux distributions share a common <SPAN 
                    class=docEmphasis>Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</SPAN> 
                    (FHS), which describes where files are located in the 
                    filesystem and how they are named. This Objective covers 
                    that standard, as well as methods of locating files. Weight:
