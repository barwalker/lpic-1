                  name=IXT-21-351117></A>Once a Linux system is installed and  
                  working, you may need to do nothing more to it. However, if  
                  you have specific security needs or just want to be cautious,  
                  you'll want to implement additional security measures on your  
                  system. </P><A name=lpicertnut-CHP-21-SECT-2.1></A>
                  <H4 class=docSection2Title>21.2.1 Shadow Passwords</H4>
                  <P class=docText>The <A name=IXT-21-351118></A><A  
                  name=IXT-21-351119></A>shadow password system enhances system  
                  security by removing encrypted passwords from the publicly  
                  available /etc/passwd file and moving them to the secured  
                  /etc/shadow file. This prevents users from running  
                  password-cracking programs against all of the encrypted  
                  passwords on your system. </P> 
                  <P class=docText>Shadow passwords are covered in <a class="docLink" href="07-1.htm">Section  
                  7.1</a> which describes user management. In order to secure a  
                  system, it is a good idea to implement shadow passwords if  
                  they aren't already. You can check this by looking for  
                  /etc/shadow and verifying that the user list matches the one  
                  in /etc/passwd. If shadow passwords are not enabled, you may  
                  enable them by entering the <SPAN  
                  class=docEmphBold>pwconv</SPAN><A name=IXT-21-351120></A> 
                  command with no arguments. In the unlikely event that you use  
                  group passwords, you should also enable group shadowing with  
                  <SPAN class=docEmphBold>grpconv</SPAN>. </P><A

                  <H4 class=docSection2Title>21.2.2 inetd Minimalism</H4>
                  <P class=docText><A name=IXT-21-351121></A>As mentioned in <a class="docLink" href="20-1.htm">Section  
                  20.1</a>, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>inetd</SPAN> and  
                  /etc/inetd.conf (its configuration file) handle access to many  
                  system services. Despite the use of TCP wrappers on these  
                  services, the best security can be achieved by simply not  
                  offering services that aren't explicitly needed. Do this by  
                  removing or commenting out lines in inetd.conf for services  
                  that are unnecessary. For example, to eliminate the <SPAN  
                  class=docEmphBold>talk</SPAN> and <SPAN  
                  class=docEmphBold>finger</SPAN> servers from your system,  
                  comment their configuration lines: </P><PRE>#talk   dgram  udp wait   root /usr/sbin/tcpd  in.talkd
#ntalk  dgram  udp wait   root /usr/sbin/tcpd  in.ntalkd
#finger stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd  in.fingerd</PRE> 
                  <P class=docText><A name=IXT-21-351122></A>After making this  
                  change, you must instruct <SPAN class=docEmphBold>inetd</SPAN>  
                  to reconfigure itself. For example: </P><PRE># <B>finger root@localhost</B>
[localhost]
Login: root                             Name: root
Directory: /root                        Shell: /bin/bash

# <B>vi /etc/inetd.conf</B>
# <B>killall -HUP inetd</B>
# <B>finger root@localhost</B>

                  <P class=docText>In this example, <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphBold>finger</SPAN> is first demonstrated to work. 
                  Then <SPAN class=docEmphBold>inetd</SPAN> is edited to disable 
                  <SPAN class=docEmphBold>fingerd</SPAN>, <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphBold>inetd</SPAN> is reconfigured, and <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphBold>finger</SPAN> stops working. </P><A

                  to administrators. To do so, add a line like this to
