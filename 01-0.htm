                  <P class=docText><A name=lpicertnut-IDXTERM-51></A>LPI Exam   
                  101 is one of two exams required for the LPIC Level 1   
                  certification. In total, 14 major Topic areas are specified   
                  for Level 1; this exam tests your knowledge on 5 of them. </P>  
                  <P class=docText><A name=IXT-1-349849></A>Exam <A   
                  name=IXT-1-349850></A>Topics are numbered using a <SPAN   
                  class=docEmphasis>level.topic</SPAN> <A   
                  name=IXT-1-349851></A>notation (e.g., 1.2, 2.5). In the LPI's   
                  early stages of development, Topics were assigned to exams   
                  based on a different scheme than we see today. When the scheme   
                  changed, the Topics were redistributed to Exams 101 and 102,   
                  but the pairing of Topic numbers to exams was dropped. As a   
                  result, we have 1.<SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN> and 2.<SPAN   
                  class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN> Topics in both Level 1 exams. </P>  
                  <P class=docText>The <A name=lpicertnut-IDXTERM-55></A>Level 1   
                  Topics are distributed between the two exams to create tests   
                  of similar length and difficulty without subject matter   
                  overlap. As a result, there's no requirement for or advantage   
                  to taking them in sequence. </P>  
                  <P class=docText>Each Topic contains a series of <A   
                  name=IXT-1-349852></A><A name=IXT-1-349853></A>Objectives   
                  covering specific areas of expertise. Each of these <A   
                  name=IXT-1-349854></A>Objectives is assigned a numeric weight,   
                  which acts as an indicator of the importance of the Objective.   
                  Weights run between 1 and 10, with higher numbers indicating   
                  more importance. An Objective carrying a weight of 1 can be   
                  considered relatively unimportant and isn't likely to be   
                  covered in much depth on the exam. Objectives with larger   
                  weights are sure to be covered on the exam, so you should   
                  study these Topics closely. The weights of the Objectives are   
                  provided at the beginning of each Topic section. </P><A

                  1-1</a> the Topic numbers assigned by the LPI are not   
                  sequential. This is due to various modifications made by the   
                  LPI to its exam program as it developed. The Topic numbers   
                  serve only as reference and are not used on the exam.<A   
                  name=IXTR3-1></A> </P>
                  <P class=docText>Exam 101 lasts a maximum of 90 minutes and 
                  contains approximately 60 questions. The exam is administered 
                  using a custom application on a PC in a private room with no 
                  notes or other reference material. About 75 percent of the 
                  exam is made up of multiple-choice single-answer questions. 
                  These questions have only one correct answer and are answered 
                  using radio buttons. Some of them present a scenario needing 
                  administrative action. Others seek appropriate commands for a 
                  particular task or for proof of understanding of a particular 
                  concept. </P>
                  <P class=docText>About 10 percent of the exam questions are   
                  multiple-choice multiple-answer questions, which are answered   
                  using checkboxes. These questions can have multiple correct   
                  responses, each of which must be checked. This is probably the   
                  most difficult question style because the multiple answers   
                  increase the likelihood of mistakes. But they also are a good   
                  test of your knowledge of Unix commands, since an incorrect   
                  response on any one of the possible answers causes you to miss   
                  the entire question. The exam also has some fill-in-the-blank   
                  questions. These questions provide a one-line text area input   
                  box for you to fill in your answer. These questions check your   
                  knowledge of concepts such as important files and commands,   
                  plus common facts that you are expected to be aware of.<A
