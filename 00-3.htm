                  <P class=docText>This book is designed to exactly follow the 
                  Topics and <A name=lpicertnut-IDXTERM-8></A>Objectives 
                  established by the LPI for Exams 101 and 102. That means that 
                  the presentation doesn't look like any other Linux book you've 
                  read. Instead, you can directly track the LPI Objectives and 
                  easily measure your progress as you prepare. </P>
                  <P class=docText>The book is presented in two parts. <A 
                  class=docLink 
                  href="01__Exam_101.htm">Part 
                  I</A> covers Exam 101 and <A class=docLink 
                  href="11__Exam_102.htm">Part 
                  II</A> covers Exam 102. Each part contains sections dedicated 
                  to the LPI Topics, and each of those sections contains 
                  information on all of the Objectives set forth for the Topic. 
                  In addition, each part contains a practice exam (with 
                  answers), review questions and exercises, and a handy 
                  "highlighter's index" that can help you review important 
                  details. </P>
                  <P class=docText>There is also a glossary at the back of the 
                  book, which you can use to help familiarize yourself with 
                  different Linux-related terms. </P><A

                    to provide you with a series of exercises that can be used 
                    on a running Linux system to give you valuable hands-on

                    able to attain at least an 80 percent score on the sample 
                    test before attempting the live exam. </P></DD></DL>

                  <P class=docText>Each Objective set forth by the LPI is 
                  assigned a numeric weight, which acts as an indicator of the 
                  importance of the Objective. <A name=IXT-0-349809></A>Weights 
                  run between 1 and 10, with higher numbers indicating more 
                  importance. An Objective carrying a weight of 1 can be 
                  considered relatively unimportant and isn't likely to be 
                  covered in much depth on the exam. Objectives with larger 
                  weights are sure to be covered on the exam, so you should 
                  study these Topics closely. The weights of the Objectives are 
                  provided at the beginning of each Topic section.<A
