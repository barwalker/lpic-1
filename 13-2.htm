                  <P class=docText>More than ever before, today's PCs are  
                  expected to be connected to a network. This means that some

                  <A name=IXT-13-350539></A>(or NIC) is used to make the  
                  connection between the computer and the network. Older

                  bus hardware, requires manual configuration. Exam 102 requires  
                  familiarity with these configuration problems. </P> 
                  <P class=docText>Generally speaking, we may think about device

                    <P class=docList>This hardware was constructed in such a way  
                    that settings were controlled by changing the position of  
                    shorting <A name=IXT-13-350542></A>jumpers on terminal  
                    strips. This method is inconvenient in that it requires  
                    internal access to the PC as well as available documentation  
                    on the jumper locations. On the other hand, it is a  
                    hardware-only solution, and the settings are obvious to the  
                    observer. Many such devices are still in service on older  
                    PCs. </P></DD></DL><A name=IXT-13-350543></A>

                    <P class=docList>These more recent hardware designs  
                    abandoned jumpers in favor of settings that, while still  
                    manually set, are stored in a <A  
                    name=IXT-13-350543></A>nonvolatile memory space. This design  
                    eliminated the physical access problem with jumpered  
                    hardware, but introduced a requirement that custom  
                    configuration programs be written, supported, and provided  
                    to consumers by hardware vendors. This software was almost  
                    always based on MS-DOS. Using these configuration tools to  
                    program a card for use under Linux may require a working  
                    MS-DOS machine to provide initial configuration.

                    <P class=docList>Most recent NICs work with the PCI bus to 
                    automatically configure themselves. The settings are done 
                    during system initialization, prior to loading the operating 
                    system. This automation eliminates manual configuration and 
                    frees the user from worrying about device conflicts.

                  <P class=docText>To configure an older NIC, you may need to 
                  set jumpers or possibly run MS-DOS and a proprietary 
                  configuration utility. More often than not, factory default 
                  settings can be used with the Linux networking drivers. 
                  However manual configuration is accomplished, you'll need to 
                  be sure that you don't have conflicts with IRQs, I/O 
                  addresses, and possibly DMA channel assignments. </P><A

                  many older Apple models (mostly 604 and earlier systems).  
                  Desktop PCs and newer Apple systems (G3 and above) usually opt  
                  for the IDE (ATA)-style disk interfaces because they are less

                  although the connector is usually replaced by a 50-pin micro-D  
                  connector. (This connector is similar to the DB-25 used for  
                  serial ports but has a much higher pin density.) As

                  <P class=docText>Recent developments have yielded additional 
                  SCSI interface types with up to 160 MBps throughput, and 
                  efforts continue to keep SCSI competitive with other 
                  technologies. As performance increases, however, constraints 
                  on cabling and connectors become more significant. Such 
                  constraints are a major factor in deploying large SCSI-based 
                  systems. Also, with the variety of connectors, cables, and 
                  transfer rates available in the SCSI standards, it's important 
                  to plan carefully. The other inhibiting factor, at least on 
                  the consumer level, is that SCSI hard drives tend to cost two 
                  to three times the amount of a similar-sized IDE drive. </P><A

                  name=IXT-13-350558></A>SCSI bus, including the controller, has  
                  an address based on a binary reading of the address lines. The  
                  8-bit SCSI buses have three address lines and thus will  
                  accommodate 2<SUP>3</SUP>=8 devices, including the controller.  
                  For the 16-bit busses, there are four address lines resulting  
                  in a possible 2<SUP>4</SUP>=16 devices. This results in a  
                  maximum of 7 and 15 devices, respectively. These addresses can  
                  be configured using jumpers (typical for disk drives) or  
                  switches. SCSI addresses run from to 7 for 8-bit buses and  
                  from to 15 for 16-bit buses. It is customary for the  
                  controller to occupy address 7 for both bus widths. Disks and  
                  other devices must be assigned a unique address on the bus,  
                  and they must be provided with proper <SPAN

                  <P class=docText>Another facet of SCSI that can be confusing  
                  is <A name=IXT-13-350562></A><A  
                  name=IXT-13-350563></A>termination. A SCSI bus can be  
                  considered a cable with devices connected along its length,  
                  but not at the ends. Instead of devices, the ends of the SCSI  
                  bus have terminators, which are simple electrical devices that  
                  condition the signal and reduce electrical noise on the bus.  
                  However, most external terminators look like a bare connector  
                  at the end of a SCSI cable. Without a terminator, a SCSI bus  
                  can be marginally functional, but it's more likely that it  
                  will fail completely, so proper termination is extremely  
                  important. Termination can be particularly problematic if you  
                  attempt to mix 8- and 16-bit devices on a single bus and use  
                  an 8-bit terminator, leaving half of the 16-bit SCSI bus  
                  unterminated. </P>
                  <P class=docText>External terminators are straightforward 
                  because they are visible. Most device manufacturers include 
                  termination circuitry on their devices, so the application of 
                  an external terminator device is not always necessary. SCSI 
                  controllers can terminate one end of the SCSI bus while an 
                  external terminator or a disk's internal terminator is used on 
                  the other end. Whichever type of terminator is being used, you 
                  must be sure that exactly one terminator is placed at each end 
                  of the SCSI bus (for a total of exactly two terminators), 
                  otherwise the bus may fail. </P><A
