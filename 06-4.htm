                  name=IXT-6-350219></A>you have spent any time working support 
                  calls on a help desk, then you already know you're an unsung 
                  hero. Within every help desk phone call received or help 
                  ticket dispatched, a problem of unknown origin and complexity 
                  awaits. Problems large and small, self-inflicted and 
                  accidental, technical and personal, will all be presented. 
                  You'll be expected to handle each of these situations with 
                  finesse, and of course deliver a timely, friendly, and helpful 
                  response even if you're given misleading information. </P>
                  <P class=docText>User support in any computing environment 
                  requires patience, perseverance, reliability, a genuine desire 
                  to help, and above all, tact. Tact is of utmost importance 
                  because, though the topic is computers, we're dealing with 
                  people in need who just want to get their job done. Often 
                  they're frustrated or even embarrassed to make a help desk 
                  call -- it's the last thing they really want to do. Once they 
                  do contact you, individuals have a unique set of expectations 
                  for your help desk performance. Corporate executives will 
                  expect kid-glove treatment even if their problems are trivial 
                  and of little importance. Uninformed users may expect 
                  immediate fixes to new and perplexing problems. Highly 
                  technical users may know a great deal about what they're 
                  asking and expect detailed responses to detailed questions. 
                  Many users will simply want to dump their problems on you so 
                  they can move on to other tasks. Despite the attendant 
                  frustrations involved with staffing a help desk, the work you 
                  encounter responding to this diversity, particularly in large 
                  enterprises, will yield an excellent education on the systems 
                  you support.<A name=IXTR3-46></A> </P><A
