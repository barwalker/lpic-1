                  name=IXT-11-350519></A>Exam 102 is the second of two exams  
                  required for the LPI's Level 1 certification. This exam tests  
                  your knowledge on 9 of the 14 major Topic areas specified for  
                  LPIC Level 1. </P>

                  Topics are numbered using a <SPAN

                  name=IXT-11-350520></A>notation (i.e., 1.1, 2.2, etc.). In the  
                  LPI's early stages of development, Topics were assigned to  
                  exams based on a different scheme than we see today. When the  
                  scheme changed, the Topics were redistributed to Exams 101 and  
                  102, but the pairing of Topic numbers to exams was dropped. As  
                  a result, we have 1.<SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN> and  
                  2.<SPAN class=docEmphasis>x</SPAN> Topics in both Level 1  
                  Exams. </P>
                  <P class=docText>The Level 1 Topics are distributed between 
                  the two exams to create tests of similar length and difficulty 
                  without subject matter overlap. As a result, there's no 
                  requirement or advantage to taking the exams in sequence. </P>
                  <P class=docText><A name=IXT-11-350521></A>Each Topic contains  
                  a series of <A name=IXT-11-350522></A>Objectives covering  
                  specific areas of expertise. Each of these Objectives is  
                  assigned a numeric weight, which acts as an indicator of the  
                  importance of the Objective. Weights run between 1 and 10,  
                  with higher numbers indicating more importance. An Objective  
                  carrying a weight of 1 can be considered relatively  
                  unimportant and isn't likely to be covered in much depth on  
                  the exam. Objectives with larger weights are sure to be  
                  covered on the exam, so you should study these topics closely.  
                  The weights of the Objectives are provided at the beginning of  
                  each Topic section. </P>

                  <P class=docText>As you can see from <a class="docLink" href="#lpicertnut-CHP-11-TABLE-1">Table  
                  11-1</a>, the Topic numbers assigned by the LPI are not  
                  sequential, due to various modifications made by the LPI to  
                  their exam program as it developed. In particular, in Exam 102  
                  two last-minute Objectives covering Red Hat and Debian package  
                  management were added to Topic 2.2. Regardless, the Topic  
                  numbers serve only as a reference and are not used on the  
                  exam.<A name=IXTR3-55></A> </P>
                  <P class=docText>Exam 102 lasts a maximum of 90 minutes and 
                  contains approximately 72 questions. The exam is administered 
                  using a custom application on a PC in a private room with no 
                  notes or other reference material. About 90 percent of the 
                  exam is made up of multiple-choice single-answer questions. 
                  These multiple-choice questions have only one correct answer, 
                  which are answered using radio buttons. A few of the questions 
                  present a scenario needing administrative action. Others seek 
                  the appropriate commands for performing a particular task or 
                  for proof of understanding of a particular concept. </P>
                  <P class=docText>The exam also includes a few multiple-choice 
                  multiple-answer questions, which are answered using 
                  checkboxes. These questions can have multiple correct 
                  responses, each of which must be checked. These are probably 
                  the most difficult type of question to answer because the 
                  possibility of multiple answers increases the likelihood of 
                  mistakes. An incorrect response on any one of the possible 
                  answers causes you to miss the entire question. </P>
                  <P class=docText>The exam also has some fill-in-the-blank 
                  questions. These questions provide a one-line text area input 
                  box for you to fill in your answer. These questions check your 
                  knowledge of concepts such as important files, commands, or 
                  well-known facts that you are expected to know. </P><A
