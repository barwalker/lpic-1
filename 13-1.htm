                  operating system) requires some familiarity with the devices  
                  installed in the system and their configuration. Items to be  
                  aware of include installed modems, serial and parallel ports,  
                  network adapters, SCSI (pronounced "scuzzy") adapters, and  
                  sound cards. Many of these devices, particularly older ones,  
                  require manual configuration of some kind to avoid conflicting  
                  resources. The rest of the configuration for the system  
                  hardware is done in the PC's firmware, or BIOS. </P><A

                  <H4 class=docSection2Title>13.1.1 BIOS</H4>
                  <P class=docText><A name=IXT-13-350528></A>The firmware  
                  located in a PC, commonly called the Basic Input/Output  
                  System, or BIOS, is responsible for bringing all of the system  
                  hardware to a state at which it is ready to boot an operating  
                  system. Systems vary, but this process usually includes system  
                  initialization, the testing of memory and other devices, and  
                  ultimately locating an operating system from among several  
                  storage devices. In addition, the BIOS provides a low-level  
                  system configuration interface, allowing the user to choose  
                  such things as boot devices and resource assignments. Quite a  
                  few vendors of BIOS firmware provide customized versions of  
                  their products for various PC system architectures.<SUP  
                  class=docFootnote>[1]</SUP> Due to these  
                  variations, it's impossible to test specifics, but the LPIC  
                  Level 1 exams do require an understanding of the basics. </P> 
                  <BLOCKQUOTE>
                    <P class=docFootnote><SUP><A name="">[1]</A></SUP> For 
                    example, a laptop BIOS may differ significantly from a 
                    desktop system of similar capability from the same 
                    manufacturer.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
                  <P class=docText>At boot time, most PCs display a method of 
                  entering the BIOS configuration utility, usually by entering a 
                  specific keystroke during startup. Once the utility is 
                  started, a menu-based screen in which system settings can be 
                  configured appears. Depending on the BIOS vendor, these will 
                  include settings for disks, memory behavior, onboard ports 
                  (such as serial and parallel ports), the clock, as well as 
                  many others. </P><A name=lpicertnut-CHP-13-SECT-1.1.1></A>
                  <H5 class=docSection3Title>13.1.1.1 Date and time</H5>
                  <P class=docText>One of the basic functions of the BIOS is to  
                  manage the onboard hardware clock. This <A  
                  name=IXT-13-350529></A>clock is initially set in the BIOS  
                  configuration by entering the date and time in the appropriate  
                  fields. Once set, the internal clock keeps track of time and  
                  makes the time available to the operating system. The  
                  operating system can also set the hardware clock, which is  
                  often useful if an accurate external time reference is  
                  available on the network while the system is running. </P><A

                  <H5 class=docSection3Title>13.1.1.2 Disks and boot 
devices</H5>
                  <P class=docText>Another fundamental configuration item 
                  required in BIOS settings is the selection of storage devices. 
                  Modern PCs can contain a variety of removable and fixed media, 
                  including floppy disks, hard disks, CD-ROMs, CD-RWs, DVD-ROMs, 
                  and Zip and/or Jaz drives. Newer systems are able to detect 
                  and properly configure much of this hardware automatically. 
                  However, older BIOS versions require manual configuration. 
                  This may include the selection of floppy disk sizes and disk 
                  drive parameters. </P>
                  <P class=docText>Most PCs have at least three <A  
                  name=IXT-13-350530></A>bootable media types: an internal hard  
                  disk (IDE or SCSI, or perhaps both), a CD-ROM drive (again IDE  
                  or SCSI), and a floppy disk. After initialization, the BIOS  
                  seeks an operating system (or an operating system loader such  
                  as the Linux Loader, LILO) on one or more of these media. By  
                  default, many BIOS configurations enable booting from the  
                  floppy or CD-ROM first, then the hard disk, but the order is  
                  configurable in the BIOS settings. </P>

                  <P class=docText>Some of the details in the BIOS configuration  
                  pertain to the internal resources of the PC architecture,  
                  including selections for <SPAN

                  (or IRQs), <A name=IXT-13-350532></A>I/O Addresses, and <A  
                  name=IXT-13-350533></A>Direct Memory Access (DMA) Channels.  
                  Interrupts are electrical signals sent to the PC's  
                  microprocessor, instructing it to stop its current activity  
                  and respond to an asynchronous event (a keystroke, for  
                  example). Modern devices in PCs often share interrupts, but  
                  older hardware requires manual verification that interrupt  
                  settings are unique to avoid conflicts with other devices.  
</P>
                  <P class=docText>I/O addresses are locations in the 
                  microprocessor's <SPAN class=docEmphasis>memory map</SPAN> (a 
                  list of defined memory addresses) reserved for input/output 
                  devices such as network interfaces. The microprocessor can 
                  write to the devices in the same way it writes to memory, 
                  which simplifies the device interface. If multiple devices 
                  inadvertently share the same I/O address, the system might 
                  behave oddly or crash. </P>
                  <P class=docText>DMA allows some devices to work directly with 
                  memory through a DMA "channel," freeing the microprocessor for 
                  other tasks. Without DMA, data must be read from I/O ports for 
                  a device and stored in memory -- all by the microprocessor. A 
                  device that has DMA capabilities has direct access to memory 
                  and writes its own data there when the microprocessor is busy 
                  with computation. This can improve performance. </P>
                  <P class=docText>All of these are finite resources, and it is  
                  important to avoid conflicting settings. <A

                  <P class=docText>Most PCs don't contain all of these devices. 
                  For example, a typical configuration includes two serial

                  used to attach external modems or terminals and occupy 
                  interrupts 4 and 3, respectively. For systems with additional

                  concurrently share the interrupt and exchange serial data. 
                  Otherwise, communications would fail if both ports from either 
                  pair were to be used together. </P>

                        possible device settings for the PC architecture, but 
                        you should be ready to answer specific questions 
                        regarding some of the more common ones, such as 
                        interrupt settings for serial and parallel ports. You 
                        should also be able to identify conflicting I/O and IRQ 
                        assignments given a scenario.

                  <P class=docText>With most PC operating systems, data loaded  
                  by the BIOS to boot the operating system is found at the  
                  beginning of the disk in the <A name=IXT-13-350535></A>Master  
                  Boot Record, or MBR. Windows users rarely have to think about  
                  the MBR because there is no alternate location for the boot  
                  record. With Linux, however, the user can place the boot  
                  loader (<A name=IXT-13-350536></A>LILO) into either the MBR or  
                  the root partition. This flexibility can lead to a problem for  
                  the BIOS and LILO and cause a failure at boot time. The  
                  failure can occur because the BIOS must load LILO into memory  
                  and start it, but the BIOS can't always access portions of the  
                  disk beyond the 1024th cylinder. If the BIOS can't read all of  
                  LILO, the boot fails. Also, older versions of LILO must have a  
                  kernel image located within the first 1024 cylinders for  
                  similar reasons. These limitations aren't significant, but do  
                  require planning during the partitioning of disks at  
                  installation time. This Topic is discussed further in <a class="docLink" href="14-2.htm">Section  
                  14.2</a>. </P>
