                  <P class=docText>Objective certification of professionals is a 
                  time-honored tradition in many fields, including medicine and 
                  law. As small computer systems and networks proliferated over 
                  the last decade, Novell and Microsoft produced extremely 
                  popular certification products for their respective operating 
                  system and network technologies. These two programs are often 
                  cited as having popularized a certification market where 
                  products that had previously been highly specialized and 
                  relatively rare. These programs have become so popular that a 
                  huge training and preparation industry has formed to service a 
                  constant stream of new certification candidates. </P>
                  <P class=docText>Certification programs, offered by vendors 
                  such as Sun and Hewlett-Packard, have existed in the Unix 
                  world for some time. However, since Solaris and HP-UX aren't 
                  commodity products, those programs don't draw the crowds that 
                  the PC platform does. <A name=IXT-0-349802></A>Linux, however, 
                  is different. Linux is both a commodity operating system and 
                  is PC-based, and its popularity continues to grow at a rapid 
                  pace. As Linux deployment increases, so too does the demand 
                  for qualified and certified Linux system administrators. </P>
                  <P class=docText>A number of programs -- the Linux 
                  Professional Institute, Sair Linux and GNU Certification, the 
                  Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) program, and CompTIA's 
                  Linux+ -- have formed over the last few years to service this 
                  new market. Each of these programs seeks to provide objective 
                  measurements of a Linux administrator's skills, but they 
                  approach the problem in different ways. </P>
                  <P class=docText>The RHCE program requires that candidates 
                  pass a hands-on practical skills test, solving problems and 
                  performing configuration tasks. Though more involved from an 
                  exam delivery point of view, this type of test is very 
                  thorough and difficult to beat using purely good study habits. 
                  The Sair program is provided by Sair, Inc., a for-profit 
                  company that is also a vendor for courseware and texts. The 
                  Linux+ exam, scheduled for deployment in 2001, is an 
                  entry-level certification, which brings us to the LPI. </P>
