                  <P class=docText>The printing process on Linux systems is  
                  governed by the "printer capability" file  
                  <I>/etc/printcap</I><A name=IXT-16-350766></A> <A  
                  name=IXT-16-350767></A>. This text file defines all of the  
                  system's available print queues and their characteristics. The  
                  file is parsed by <SPAN class=docEmphBold>lpd</SPAN><I>,</I>  
                  which ignores blank lines and comments beginning with a pound  
                  sign (<TT>#</TT>). Each printer definition in the file  
                  comprises one logical line, which is often broken up among  
                  multiple physical lines in the file using the <TT>\</TT>  
                  line-continuation character. The definition itself is made up  
                  of fields delimited by colons. The first field, which begins  
                  in the first column of the file, holds the system name for the  
                  printer, such as <SPAN class=docEmphBold>lp</SPAN>. This field  
                  may contain aliases for the printer name separated by vertical  
                  bars. The rest of the fields in the definition hold mnemonics  
                  providing control flags and printer parameters. A basic  
                  <I>printcap</I> file defining a single printer is shown in <a class="docLink" href="#lpicertnut-CHP-16-EX-1">Example

                  <P class=docText>As you can see, the installation creates 
                  three printer definitions, each with multiple aliases and each 
                  using the same output device. This allows some degree of 
                  control over the filter, because the selection of the queue 
                  implies specific print parameters. The first definition 
                  (<TT>ascii</TT>) is intended to allow the user to force the 
                  printing of plain text even if the data is a PostScript 
                  program. The second entry (<SPAN class=docEmphBold>lp</SPAN>, 
                  the default) is the standard magic <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphBold>APSfilter</SPAN>, which tries to identify 
                  the data type itself. The last definition allows users to 
                  force <SPAN class=docEmphBold>APSfilter</SPAN> to send raw 
                  data directly to the printer with no intervention. This can be 
                  useful, for example, if you wish to print a PostScript file's 
                  programming instructions. <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphBold>APSfilter</SPAN> also configures logging and 
                  accounting for each printer queue. Finally, the setup routine 
                  optionally prints a graphical test page to verify your 
                  installation. </P>
                  <P class=docText>After <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphBold>APSfilter</SPAN> is installed, you must

                  are configuration for Ghostscript features, special control 
                  sequences for printers, and configuration for the use of a
