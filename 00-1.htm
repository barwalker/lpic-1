                  <P class=docText>The <A name=IXT-0-349803></A>Linux 
                  Professional Institute, or LPI (<A class=docLink 
                  href="http://www.lpi.org/" 
                  target=_blank>http://www.lpi.org/</A>), is a nonprofit 
                  organization formed around the notion of certifying Linux 
                  administrators through a sort of open source process. The LPI 
                  seeks input from the public for its exam Objectives and 
                  questions, and anyone is welcome to participate. It has both 
                  paid and volunteer staff and receives funding from some major 
                  names in the computer industry. The result is a 
                  vendor-neutral, publicly developed program that is offered at 
                  a reasonable price. </P>
                  <P class=docText>The LPI organizes its Linux Professional 
                  Institute Certification (LPIC) series into three levels: LPIC 
                  Levels 1, 2, and 3. Each level consists of two exams that are 
                  priced at $100 each. This book covers the <A 
                  name=IXT-0-349804></A>LPIC Level 1 exams, numbers 101 and 102. 
                  </P><A name=lpicertnut-PREF-SECT-1.1></A>
                  <H4 class=docSection2Title>LPI Level 1 Exams</H4>
                  <P class=docText>The LPI offers its exams through <A 
                  name=IXT-0-349805></A>Virtual University Enterprises (<A 
                  class=docLink href="http://www.vue.com/" 
                  target=_blank>http://www.vue.com/</A>). You may establish an 
                  online account with VUE and resister for the exams using the 
                  company's web site. VUE has more than two thousand testing 
                  centers worldwide, making the exams accessible in most areas. 
                  The exams are presented in English using a PC-based automated 
                  examination program. Exam questions are presented in 
                  multiple-choice single-answer, multiple-choice 
                  multiple-answer, and fill-in-the-blank styles. However, a 
                  majority of the questions on the exams are multiple-choice 
                  single-answer. </P>
                  <P class=docText>Level 1 is aimed at junior to midlevel Linux 
                  administrators, who should be comfortable with Linux at the 
                  command line as well as capable of performing simple tasks, 
                  including system installation and troubleshooting. While Exams 
                  101 and 102 are not constructed to be difficult or misleading, 
                  together they encompass a wide body of material, making 
                  preparation important for success even for experienced 
                  administrators. </P>
                  <P class=docText>Each of the exams covers a series of <A 
                  name=IXT-0-349806></A><A name=IXT-0-349807></A>Topics, which 
                  are numbered using a <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>level.topic</SPAN> <A 
                  name=IXT-0-349808></A>notation (i.e., 1.2, 2.5, etc.). In the 
                  LPI's early stages of development, Topics were assigned to 
                  exams based on a different scheme than we see today. When the 
                  scheme changed, the Topics were redistributed to Exams 101 and 
                  102, but the pairing of Topic numbers to exams was dropped. As 
                  a result, we have 1.x and 2.x Topics in both Level 1 Exams. 
                  </P>
                  <P class=docText>Each Topic contains a series of Objectives 
                  covering specific areas of expertise. The Level 1 Topics are 
                  distributed between the two exams to create tests of similar 
                  length and difficulty without subject matter overlap. As a 
                  result, there's no requirement for or advantage to taking them 
                  in sequence. Exam 101 tests five Topics in approximately 60 
                  questions, and Exam 102 tests nine Topics in approximately 72 
                  questions. Each exam is limited to 90 minutes. </P>
