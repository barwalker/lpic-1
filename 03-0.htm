                  <H2 class=docChapterTitle>Chapter 3. GNU and Unix Commands 
                  (Topic 1.3)</H2>
                  <P class=docText>This Topic covers the ever-important aspect 
                  of working interactively with Linux command-line utilities. 
                  While it's true that GUI tools are already available to manage 
                  just about everything on a Linux system, a firm understanding 
                  of basic use of command-line utilities is essential. </P>
                  <P class=docText>The family of <A 
                  name=lpicertnut-IDXTERM-72></A>commands that are part of Linux 
                  and Unix systems has a long history. Individuals or groups 
                  that needed specific tools contributed many of the commands in 
                  the early days of Unix development. Those that were popular 
                  became part of the system and were accepted as default tools 
                  under the Unix umbrella. Today, Linux systems carry new, often 
                  more powerful <SPAN class=docEmphasis>GNU</SPAN> versions of 
                  these historical commands. </P>
                  <P class=docText>This section covers LPI Topic 1.3, <SPAN 
                  class=docEmphasis>GNU and Unix Commands</SPAN>. Even the Topic 
                  name implies the confusion that may exist regarding the origin 
                  of the commands we're using on GNU/Linux systems. Remember 
                  that for software to be freely distributed as part of your 
                  Linux distribution, it cannot be proprietary and must come 
                  with some form of redistribution ability in its licensing 
                  terms. </P>
                  <P class=docText>This LPI Topic has seven Objectives:</P>
                  <DL class=docList>
                    <DT><I><SPAN class=docPubcolor>Objective 1: Work Effectively 
                    on the Unix Command Line</SPAN></I> 
                    <DD>
                    <P class=docList>This Objective covers the essentials of 
                    working at the command line in a shell, including 
                    environment variables, using the command history and editing 
                    facilities, invoking commands, command substitution, and 
                    recursively executing commands. Weight: 4. </P></DD></DL>
                  <DL class=docList>
                    <DT><I><SPAN class=docPubcolor>Objective 2: Process Text 
                    Streams Using Text-Processing Filters</SPAN></I> 
                    <DD>
                    <P class=docList>There exists a diverse "toolbox" of 
                    interesting and powerful utilities from the GNU <SPAN 
                    class=docEmphBold>textutils</SPAN> package, which can be 
                    used to manipulate text in various ways. This Objective 
                    covers those utilities and how to use them. Weight: 7. 
                    </P></DD></DL>
                  <DL class=docList>
                    <DT><I><SPAN class=docPubcolor>Objective 3: Perform Basic 
                    File Management</SPAN></I> 
                    <DD>
                    <P class=docList>If you're used to an entirely GUI computing 
                    environment, performing basic file management manually from 
                    the command line may be awkward at first. You'll find, 
                    however, that after mastering a few simple commands you will 
                    achieve much finer control over file management chores. This 
                    Objective covers simple and recursive file management, 
                    including the use of wildcards (regular expressions). 
                    Weight: 2. </P></DD></DL>
                  <DL class=docList>
                    <DT><I><SPAN class=docPubcolor>Objective 4: Use Unix 
                    Streams, Pipes, and Redirects</SPAN></I> 
                    <DD>
                    <P class=docList>Among the most powerful concepts in the 
                    Linux and Unix worlds is the idea of creating text streams. 
                    This powerful tool offers you the ability to succinctly 
                    string various commands (such as those described in 
                    Objective 2) together into customized editing chains, which 
                    modify text in a serial fashion. Objective 4 includes 
                    redirection and the use of the <SPAN 
                    class=docEmphBold>tee</SPAN> command. Weight: 3. 
</P></DD></DL>
                  <DL class=docList>
                    <DT><I><SPAN class=docPubcolor>Objective 5: Create, Monitor, 
                    and Kill Processes</SPAN></I> 
                    <DD>
                    <P class=docList>Every running program on a Linux system is 
                    a <SPAN class=docEmphasis>process</SPAN>. Some processes are 
                    short-lived, like utility programs such as <SPAN 
                    class=docEmphBold>ls</SPAN>. Other processes, usually called 
                    <I>daemons</I>, are intended to run for extended periods or 
                    even constantly; these include processes such as web or 
                    database server software. Managing these processes is an 
                    important activity for a system administrator. This 
                    Objective covers foreground and background processing, 
                    process monitoring, signaling, and how to "kill" a process. 
                    Also covered are some of the commands used to manipulate 
                    running processes. Weight: 5. </P></DD></DL>
                  <DL class=docList>
                    <DT><I><SPAN class=docPubcolor>Objective 6: Modify Process 
                    Execution Priorities</SPAN></I> 
                    <DD>
                    <P class=docList>When you launch a process, you may wish to 
                    instruct the system to lower or raise its <SPAN 
                    class=docEmphasis>scheduling priority</SPAN> relative to the 
                    default. This action has the effect of giving more or less 
                    CPU time to your process. This is accomplished with the 
                    <SPAN class=docEmphBold>nice</SPAN> command, which modifies 
                    the default scheduling priority prior to running your 
                    command. This Objective covers these modifications. Weight: 
                    2. </P></DD></DL>
                  <DL class=docList>
                    <DT><I><SPAN class=docPubcolor>Objective 7: Perform Searches 
                    of Text Files Making Use of Regular Expressions</SPAN></I> 
                    <DD>
                    <P class=docList>Many tools on your Linux system are capable 
                    of using <SPAN class=docEmphasis>regular expressions</SPAN>. 
                    At the most basic level, regular expressions are simply 
                    wildcard-matching mechanisms, such as you've probably used 
                    at the command line many times. While detailed use is beyond 
                    the scope of this book and the LPI exams, regular 
                    expressions are a powerful solution to a range of problems. 
                    This Objective covers basic regular expression usage with 
                    command-line tools such as <SPAN 
                    class=docEmphBold>sed</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                    class=docEmphBold>grep</SPAN>. Weight: 3. </P></DD></DL>
                  <P class=docText>The tools and concepts discussed here 
                  represent important and fundamental aspects of working with 
                  Linux, and are essential for your success on Exam 101. </P>
