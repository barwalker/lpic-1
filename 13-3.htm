                  transmitting information via telephone lines. A modem on the

                  its digital form. Modems can also add digital compression and

                  <H5 class=docSection3Title>13.3.1.1 Modem types</H5>
                  <P class=docText>Modems are serial devices, where data enters 
                  and exits one bit at a time. Traditionally, modems were 
                  external devices attached via cable to industry standard 
                  RS-232 serial ports, such as those still found on most PCs. 
                  This arrangement continues to work well, because the data 
                  rates of telephone connections are still below the maximum 
                  rate of the serial ports. As a result, external devices yield 
                  solid performance. Internal modems (ISA or PCI bus cards that 
                  reside inside a PC) were developed to reduce costs associated 
                  with external modems (namely, the case, power supply, and 
                  shipping charges) and offer the same functionality as an 
                  external modem. </P>
                  <P class=docText>Most internal modems present themselves to  
                  the PC as a standard serial port. In a typical PC with the  
                  first two serial ports built in (<I> /dev/ttyS0</I> and  
                  <I>/dev/ttyS1</I>), an internal modem will appear as the third  
                  port (<I> /dev/ttys2</I>). This means that from a programming  
                  point of view, internal modems are indistinguishable from  
                  external modems. While there is some variation in modem  
                  configuration across manufacturers, the differences are small,  
                  and most serial-port-style modems will work with Linux. One  
                  exception is a modem designed specifically to work with the  
                  Windows operating system. These so-called <SPAN  
                  class=docEmphasis>WinModems</SPAN> rely on the CPU and a  
                  special software driver to handle some of the communications  
                  processing, thus lack the full hardware capabilities of  
                  standard modems. As such, WinModems are not compatible with  
                  Linux unless a Linux-specific driver is available. Information  
                  on such support is available from <A class=docLink  
                  href="http://www.linmodems.org/" 
                  target=_blank>http://www.linmodems.org/</A>. One example of  
                  such support is an effort by IBM to support <SPAN

                  resources</H5>
                  <P class=docText>As with any add-on card, particularly cards 
                  configured manually, the user must be careful to avoid 
                  resource conflicts. Modems shouldn't cause much difficulty 
                  since they're simple serial ports. However, you should confirm 
                  that the correct interrupt and I/O addresses are set on your 
                  modem. If the modem shares an interrupt with another serial 
                  port, that port cannot be used at the same time as the modem.

                  the industry standard chipset originally defined by Creative  
                  Labs with its SoundBlaster series. Part of the configuration  
                  for a sound card involves correctly specifying the sound  
                  card's resources to the sound driver, which is a kernel
